# clj-retry

[clj-rery is this gist in library form](https://gist.github.com/aphyr/a81825ab80656679db78)

It's really inconvenient not being able to recur from within `catch` forms.

This library provides `with-retry` as an alternative to `try`, which acts as a recusrion point.

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[clj-retry.core :refer [with-retry]])

(with-retry [i 0]
  (if (< i 5)
    (throw (Exception.))
    (println "done"))
  (catch Exception _
    (println i)
    (retry (inc i))))

;; this code prints:

0
1
2
3
4
done
```
